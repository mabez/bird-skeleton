 * set in Pre-activate.
 * The following environment variables are accessable to the script:
 * 
 * - ZS_RUN_ONCE_NODE - a Boolean flag stating whether the current node is
 *   flagged to handle "Run Once" actions. In a cluster, this flag will only be set when
 *   the script is executed on once cluster member, which will allow users to write
 *   code that is only executed once per cluster for all different hook scripts. One example
 *   for such code is setting up the database schema or modifying it. In a
 *   single-server setup, this flag will always be set.
 * - ZS_WEBSERVER_TYPE - will contain a code representing the web server type
 *   ("IIS" or "APACHE")

 * - ZS_WEBSERVER_UID - will contain the web server user id

 *   application is staged.

 *   being installed, as it is specified in the package descriptor file
 * - ZS_PREVIOUS_APP_VERSION - will contain the previous version of the application
 *   being updated, if any. If this is a new installation, this variable will be
 *   empty. This is useful to detect update scenarios and handle upgrades / downgrades
 *   in hook scripts
 * - ZS_<PARAMNAME> - will contain value of parameter defined in deployment.xml, as specified by
 *   user during deployment.
